## About
A complete set of react components for use in Adobe UXP extensions.

At the time of this writing React Spectrum is not entirely universal and their exists many quirks to the use of Spectrum components in react.

This package aims to make development of UXP plugins using react a breeze and encapsulates all of the quirks and oddities that come with a web-component based library being used in react.

## Contribute
Pull Requests welcome!

These components are derived from the [documentation for uxp spectrum](https://www.adobe.io/xd/uxp/uxp/reference-spectrum/Overview/) and use in my own projects. The components may very well be missing features that are loosely documented or undocumented and will need patches as things change or are discovered.
